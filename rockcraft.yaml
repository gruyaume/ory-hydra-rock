description: |
    Ory Hydra is a hardened, OpenID Certified OAuth 2.0 Server and OpenID Connect Provider optimized for low-latency, high throughput, and low resource consumption. 
    Ory Hydra is not an identity provider (user sign up, user login, password reset flow), but connects to your existing identity provider through a login and consent app. 
    Implementing the login and consent app in a different language is easy, and exemplary consent apps (Node) and SDKs for common languages are provided.
